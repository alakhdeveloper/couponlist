# Coupon Listing on Cart Page
With the help of coupon list plugin, assist your customers to take the benefits of attractive discounts before placing the order on your online store. Display all the coupons to the customer in a list form on the cart or checkout page, so they can get most of the offers & take home the products at the best price from a single place. The admin can restrict the coupons to be visible on the frontend & can also limit the number of coupons to be shown under the list of all available coupons.
